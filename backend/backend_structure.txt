config/

dbConfig.js: Manages database configurations for SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production). This file centralizes the database connection logic, making it easier to switch between SQLite and PostgreSQL.
controllers/

authController.js: Handles user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and password reset.
userController.js: Manages user profile-related operations, such as updating personal information.
transactionController.js: Handles CRUD operations for financial transactions.
budgetController.js: Manages user budget-related operations like creating, updating, and deleting budgets.
middlewares/

authMiddleware.js: Middleware for authenticating JWT tokens. This is used to protect routes that require users to be logged in.
models/

User.js: Defines the User model, including fields like username, email, password_hash, etc., and methods for database interaction.
Transaction.js: Defines the Transaction model to interact with the transactions table.
Budget.js: Defines the Budget model to interact with the budgets table.
routes/

authRoutes.js: Defines all routes related to authentication (e.g., /api/signup, /api/login).
userRoutes.js: Defines routes for managing user profiles (e.g., /api/user/profile).
transactionRoutes.js: Defines routes for managing financial transactions (e.g., /api/transactions).
budgetRoutes.js: Defines routes for managing budgets (e.g., /api/budgets).
migrations/

initialSchema.sql: Contains SQL scripts to set up initial database tables (users, transactions, budgets). This is especially useful when migrating to PostgreSQL.
utils/

jwtUtils.js: Contains utility functions for generating and verifying JWT tokens.
validation.js: Contains helper functions for input validation, e.g., validating email format, required fields, etc.
Root Files

app.js: The main application file that ties everything together. It initializes Express, configures middleware, connects routes, and starts the server.
package.json: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
.env: Stores environment variables (e.g., secret keys, database connection strings). We will use dotenv to read these values.
